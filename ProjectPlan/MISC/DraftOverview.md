Re-Entry App – A Technology System to Reduce Recidivism

#Key Reactions

> There is much good content and many great new ideas introduced in this document.  However, the document needs a lot of work before it is ready for distribution.  The existing project plan is also very drafty and more than one page however it includes only content that has been vetted and reflects the conversations of the project team. Some of the new content is problematic.

> The language in our current [project plan](https://github.com/ReEntry/DesignPhase/blob/master/ProjectPlan/ProjectPlan.md) is preferable to the new terms introduced in this draft.  The existing project plan states that the deliverable will be: **"A prototype file demonstrating the user experience and other key featured, functions and flows of the App (this may be based on interactive wireframes or may include working code)."**  Similarly, the remarks of K Krasnow Waterman were **"Consider changing the first sentence in the project summary from 'Project funding for development and efforts past v1 will largely come from outside sources.' to 'Project funding for MVP development and efforts past v1 will largely come from outside sources.'  In it’s current form, I thought it was a promise to produce an MVP without funding."**  K's view and the existing current project plan accurately reflect the agreed and appropriate degree of committment to technical outcomes and business results that can reasonably be expected at the conclusion of the design and rapid prototype phase.  

> It is very important to avoid inviting expectations that this rapid prototype and design phase is intended to result in a system that will be suited for operation in the regular course of business  Perhaps the concept of a prototype is unfamiliar.  Mission critical interactions, sensitive data or important operations should never rely upon a prototype and in fact, the code developed for a prototype should be expected to be replacable or refactored to achieve production-grade purposes and meet minimum performance metrics.  A thoughtful rapid prototype can, however, be a profound business value when developed through an iterative process with the stakeholders.  A prototype, when iteratived as part of a well crafted design phase, can help to surface goals, objectives, success metrics, functions, flows and other particulars that would otherwise never be considered, discussed, agreed or developed.  

> Despite spending some hours attempting to conform the many pages of the current draft, not much progress was made.  Therefore, the existing project plan should be used as the basis of conversation until a proper and agreed one pager that is one page in length can be developed.  In the meantime, it is recommended and requested that any necessary or desirable changes to the existing project plan be made directly to the document in GitHub.  If any project team member would like tutoring on use of GitHub I volunteer to do so at the member's earliest convenience.  GitHub has been the project repository in significant part due to it's superior version control and distributed project collaboration strengths.  Unfortunately, [edits completed on the initial draft](https://github.com/ReEntry/DesignPhase/blob/master/ProjectPlan/MISC/FirstRevisedDraftOverview.md) and emailed to the group on do not appear to have been taken into this duplicate and inconsistent MS Word document.  It is very important to avoid further needless wasted time with MS Word documents emails around, duplicating existing GitHub project plans and attracting threads of edits that are difficult to re-sythesize. 

**Background**

In recent years Judge Aiken, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District Court of Oregon, has implemented an innovative re-entry program in which all parties to the criminal justice system collaborate with the re-entering individual to try to reduce recidivist behavior. Participants in this program have demonstrated a 16% reduction in recidivism as compared with participants in standard re-entry programs. This innovative program is based upon limiting the following five criminogenic factors that correlate to increased recidivism. Specifically:

1. Substance Abuse
1. Mental Health
1. Education
1. Family Environment
1. Employment

The program emphasizes personal responsibility for the individual and is based upon the core values of “Trust, Transparency, and Truth.”

**Project Summary**

The project team will manage the development of a technological component of or overlay to Judge Aiken’s existing innovative re-entry/recidivism prevention program. This technological component, or system, will have two functional pieces: (1) a court-facing or parole officer-facing dashboard module that will allow the court/parole officer to track the individual’s progress, real-time movements, and to provide timely strategic interventions to help reduce recidivism, and (2) a participant-facing module, most likely in the form of an application developed for a mobile platform (currently expected to be Android), that will enable and empower program participants to succeed in their re-entry journey. 

**Project Purposes**

The system will serve 4 broad criminal justice and recidivism prevention purposes:

> It is premature to conclude these specific and exclusive purposes. 

1. **Education.** 

The system will serve as a tool to educate program participants on the use of technology, access to resources to help in their reentry process, career development resources, and other key information.

2. **Public Safety.** 

The system will serve as a public safety tool by making it easier for parole officers to track and identify parolees and reentrants who need immediate assistance before they reoffend.

3. **ReEntrant** **Empowerment.** 

The program will empower program participants by providing them with real-time access to information about their reentry process in a manner that is easily understood and utilized. For example, participants will be able to easily and clearly track their urinalysis results over an extended period of time. Similarly, participants will have ready, immediate, and meaningful access to information regarding their success in meeting court dates, parole officer meetings, and substance abuse support group meetings.

4. **Resource Allocation.** 

On both a small and larger scale, the system will allow jurisdictions to measure their reentry efforts and successes thereby enabling them to allocate resources more efficiently.



**Project System Components**

It is envisioned that when implemented, the system will have two key components: (1) a participant-side application (likely in the form of a mobile device), and, (2) a probation or parole officer-side application – to provide communications, management and dashboard functionality.  

The system will be designed to track, measure, and analyze the five following criminogenic factors which when more prevalent are more likely to result in increased criminal behavior.

1. Substance Abuse
1. Mental Health
1. Education
1. Family Environment
1. Employment

_Probation or Parole Officer-Side:_ The court or parole officer-facing module will provide the parole officer with real-time insight into the activities and progress of the individual. Most if not all information visible to the individual in the application will be visible to the parole officer, including the individual’s use of the application and activity. The parole officer module will be combined with “big data” analytics across all program participants and other criminogenic research to try and discern when certain activities by a specific individual in the program may indicate the likelihood for that individual to violate the conditions of their parole. This will give the courts and parole officer an opportunity to intervene in strategic instances to try to support the individual and help to reduce recidivism. 

_Participant-Side:_ The participant-side application will likely take the form of a mobile application on the Android platform. While the overall application design is still TBD, the project team sketched out a proposed specification that is included as an attachment to this document. 

**Application Versions**

At this point, the project team sees two project versions: a first version or “v1” and all subsequent versions “vNext.”

_Development of v1:_ 
 The v1 system will represent a prototype or minimum viable product (“MVP”). It will incorporate the basic functionality that the steering committee (or the most minimally viable version of this committee as can be quickly organized) identifies as key to a basic version of the system. This version will be developed either at a hackathon at MIT or through MIT-identified resources. Upon completion of the v1, the project team will formally transition ownership of the project to the Steering Committee.

_Development of_ _vNext:_ vNext represents all versions of development after completion of v1 and delivery of v1 to the Steering Committee. Anticipated plans for vNext versions include deeper data analytics, implementing guidance on Web 2.0 and key internet technology guidance from Technology Expert Committee, and counseling with and deriving greater information from the Criminal Justice Expert Advisory Panel. vNext versions will be completed on project partners’ individual time, by community members interested in the project, through hackathon or other volunteer or mission-driven activities, or paid for with funds raised to support ongoing development of the project.  	 

**Project Participants**

The project will be driven by four main committees: 
1. Stakeholder Committee

1. Project Committee

1. Criminal Justice Expert/Advisory Committee

1. Web/Technology Expert/Advisory Committee 
(More about the composition and specific responsibilities of these committees can be found on the ReEntry App “Who” summary page)

**Project Funding**

Project funding for development and efforts past v1 will largely come from outside sources. Three potential sources have been identified to date:

1. The Legal Access Job Corps is an ABA Presidential Initiative that promotes marshaling the resources of newly-admitted lawyers in ways that expand legal services to underserved populations, including people of low and moderate incomes. The initiative is awarding small catalyst grants to those working to advance this mission. Details about the grants and the application process are at[http://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/office_of_the_president/legal_access_jobs_corps.html](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/office_of_the_president/legal_access_jobs_corps.html) 

1. Here’s a Bureau of Justice Affairs grant which might be an idea for this project: [https://www.bja.gov/Funding/14SmartSupervisionSol.pdf](https://www.bja.gov/Funding/14SmartSupervisionSol.pdf)  I think it needs to be sponsored by a government agency, which could then fund some of the work

1. There are also private foundations, such as the Ford Foundation, that have criminal justice initiatives.




**Attachment** **A**

This project will use technology to implement the same principles that Judge Aiken successfully applied in her recidivism prevention program. Specifically, the application will feature five key functionalities:

**Crisis,** **Me,** **Job,** **Communication,** **Schedule**

Please see the simple wireframe in Attachment A to this document showing a sample UI for the application homescreen.
Each of these key functionalities is tied to a criminogenic recidivism factor. The app is designed to help reduce the incidence of each criminogenic factor in an individual’s life and, thereby, hopefully limit a given individual’s tendency to recidivate. 

Each tab is discussed below:

**Crisis:**

This tab will provide the individual with immediate contact with a parole officer or other support.

**Me:**

This tab will consist of two main aspects:  
- First: A status tracker which will enable the individual to monitor their progress against key criminogenic factors manifest in the application.  
- Second: Access for the participant to contact information for their family, friends, and other loved ones

**Job:**

This tab will connect the individual with employment resources such as job posts, networking opportunities, and education modules. These modules and resources may be able to be customized depending upon the individual’s needs and skills.

**Communication:**

This tab will provide the individual with access to text functionality to parole officer and volunteer support individuals as well as, potentially, counsellors and other contacts.

**Schedule:**

In this module the individual will have access to a calendaring function. The parole officer or other official will be able to push calendaring events to the individual’s application. Pushed events will include random and scheduled urinalysis appointments, counseling visits (both group and individual), family visitation opportunities (if applicable), court dates, probation “check-in” appointments and others. The individual will also be able to schedule their own events. The receipt of push notifications will be made prominently visible throughout the application UI and reminders for important events will also surface on the homescreen and, possibly, in other places in the app.

# Participants


ReEntry App – Project Participants

The project consists of four main committees: 

## 1)	Stakeholder Committee: 

This committee will oversee development of the project. The stakeholder committee will be the ultimate “recipient” and owner of the project and will see to its long-term management and adoption. This committee will be very quickly and leanly staffed for the v1 version of the project but will be filled out as necessary into vNext versions.

a.	Members: 

i.	Chair: The stakeholder committee will likely be chaired by Judge Ann Aiken of the Oregon Federal District Court.

ii.	Mark Sherman 

## 2)	Project Team:

The project team will see development of the project through, at least, the initial design and prototyping of the project. The project team has the longest-standing relationship with the project.  The project committee will also likely include the developers who will do some of the heavy lifting in actually coding the project. Upon development of v1 of the project the Project Committee will cease its organized day-to-day activities and continue on an ad hoc basis.

a.	Dan Lear

b.	Lina Kaisey

c.	Joyce Searles

d.	Joshua Lenon

e.	K. Krasnow Waterman

f.	Eric Adler

g.	Dazza Greenwood 

h.	Development resources

## 3)	Expert/Advisory Committee: 

This committee will provide guidance and feedback on specific aspects of the project as may be needed in development and roll-out. The sole committee member of this project at this time is Rebecca Henshaw, Judge Aiken’s deputy. This panel will consist of experts to advise the project team on the application itself. We expect that these will be individuals familiar with principles underlying the application such as the reentry/parole process, data privacy, rehabilitation, professional development, mental health and others.

a.	Rebecca Henshaw – Judge Aiken’s deputy has been identified as the main member of this committee.

## 4)	Web/Technology Expert/Advisory Committee:  

This committee will provide guidance on specific technological and web 2.0 topics in order to make the project as technologically sound and effective as possible.
