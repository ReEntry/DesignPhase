**NOTE: THIS IS A *DRAFT* DOCUMENT.** It is intended solely for discussion purposes and does not represent any specific obligation for any party involved. It's main purpose is to try to document the current trajectory of the project and spur discussion about short and long term activities and goals. 

# Summary
This is a draft attempt at framing the ReEntry project aspirations, goals, and trajectory over the coming 6-12 months and, to the extent applicable, beyond. See the [Project Plan](https://github.com/ReEntry/DesignPhase/blob/master/ProjectPlan/ProjectPlan.md), [this video](http://legalhackathon.net/2014/02/10/federal-judge-aiken-calls-for-an-app-legal-hackers-answer/) or the [Bloomberg article written on the project](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-07/an-app-to-turn-an-ex-cons-phone-into-little-brother) for additional information on substance of the project itself. 

# Background
The project team has worked on ReEntry since February. Over that time, the team has developed a clearer idea of what the project is and can become, at least in coming months. While the [Project Plan](https://github.com/ReEntry/DesignPhase/blob/master/ProjectPlan/ProjectPlan.md) is an excellent document it is admittedly drafty and does not take into account broader discussions that the project team and others have had since its creation nearly 2 months ago. 

This new document will hopefully establish a clearer, mutually agreeable, vision for the project and provide a roadmap for next steps.

# Development
This project will be an "open research project" (at least in so far as MIT is involved, and, ideally, for the entirety of the project) and will adopt an open architecture approch to development. Details on development and architecture can be found in Appendix A to this document.

# Project Stages.

The project team sees three distinct project stages through which the project will progress over the next 6-12 months. 

What immediately follows is a short description of each stage. A fuller description of each stage follows that, later in the document.   


1. Stage 1 - Rapid Prototype/Design Stage: The goal of this stage is to create a prototype version of the ReEntry app. This stage will occur between now and June 30, 2014

2. Stage 2 - Incubation and Evangelism: The goal of this stage will be to promote the prototype created in Stage 1, seek out opportunities to expand development of the prototype and/or project (including but not limited to funding opportunities), and generally evangelize the longer-term aspects of the project. This stage will occur between June 30, 2014 and the ABA Access to Justice Hackathon scheduled for approximately August 10, 2014. 

3. Stage 3 - The details of this stage are largely unclear but it will begin on August 10, 2014 and will include longer term thinking on the development and adoption of the project technology. This stage currently has no end date as much that happens in the prior two stages will determine the characteristics and activities of this stage.


# Detailed Description of Stages
The following is a more detailed description of the three stages described above.

# Stage 1
## Stage 1 Application Description: 
This rapid prototype/design version demonstrating the user experience and other key featured, functions and flows of the App (this may be based on interactive wireframes or may include working code). This prototype version will not be suited for "live" use with mission critical interactions, sensitive data, or important interactions. The prototype code should be expected to be replacable or refactored to achieve production-grade purposes and meet minimum performance metrics. 

## Stage 1 Phases:
Stage 1 will include 3 Phases: (1) Project Initiation, (2) Development, and (3) Delivery

### Phase 1:Project Initiation.
#### a.  This phase has two aspects: (1) empaneling the two committees necessary for project and (2) kick-off.

#### b. Empanel Steering Committee and Expert Advisory Panel:

i. Steering Committee: Judge Aiken has identified Mark Sherman as one potential member of the Steering Committee.(For the first stage, the Steering Committee we will take a "minimally viable steering committee" approach. While we will continue to try and identify and recruit steering committee members throughout Stage 1, for purposes of kick-off, the Steering Committee will be composed of Mark Sherman, Judge Aiken, K. Krasnow Waterman and one or two other currently identified and available individuals.)

ii. Expert Advisory Panel: Any member of the Steering Committee or Project Team can and should nominate members of this panel. MIT will propose several top technical experts for this panel. Rebecca Henshaw is point of contact for the subject matter experts who will serve on this panel. Ms. Henshaw will help identify the best contacts to provide guidance on topics deemed that need to be considered by the advisory panel.

#### c. Kick-off:

i. Schedule and hold a kick-off meeting to validate current project design, conduct additional project design, confirm schedule and otherwise direct project.


### Phase 2: Development
#### a. The development process will be conducted by the following groups/roles. 

i. Developers. Once the project committees above have been properly empanelled the project team will work to recruit and support developers to build a prototype, alpha, and or beta version of the application/program.

ii. Project Team. The project team will work to execute the project by coordinating with the developers and the expert advisory panel, facilitating direct communication between the developers and the expert advisory panel,communicating status and otherwise collaborating with the Steering Committee.

iii. Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will oversee development and, hopefully, broader promotion of the project.


### Phase 3: Delivery
#### a. The development process will be conducted by the following groups/roles. 

i. Final Presentation and Opportunity for Pilot-Phase Launch.

ii. Account transfer and ownership assignment of the GitHub Project. All project data (both public and private) including work flow (i.e. via issues tickets, authorization roles for accounts of contributors and other participants, open source licenses, etc) will be transitioned to Steering Committee or its designee.

iii. Hand-Off. The hand-off will include a Google Hangout for a “final presentation” using slides, screen share, video and/or other online methods to walk through the deliverables and repositories, discuss/questions.

#Appendix A: Development and Architecture Details

## Open Research Project 

Please note, the MIT Media Lab Computational Legal Science research team is providing facilitation and convening support for the Design and Rapid Prototype phase as one of our discretionary/volunteer "Open Research Projects".  This means that we are not charging money or requiring an exisitng research sponsor of the lab to support the activity, but all of our work and contributions are provided under open source free software licenses and creative commons free copyright licenses and all project materials that are contributed under the auspicies of the MIT convening are considered public, non-confidential and are openly accessible on our web site and/or in our GitHub repositories.  

To the extent confidential, secret, private or otherwise access restricted resources are needed or expected as part of work on the ReEntryApp, please be careful not to include those materials in the GitHub repository or to provide them to MIT research or other staff or otherwise to contribute those materials to the GitHub or websites set up by MIT to support this project during the Design and Rapid Prototype Phase.  However, at the conclusion of this phase, when MIT and the Project Team hand over the materials, repositories and other resources to the Stakeholder Committee, then you may wish to choose other ways to handle intellectual property, confidentiality agreements or other aspects of access control with respect to the project content transmitted as a deliverable.  During this Design and Rapid Prototype Phase, please simply be careful to use other channels for transmission or storage of non-open resources.

## Open Architecture 

It is expected that the code comprising the rapid prototuype during the initial phase of this project will leverage existing open source code or will be developed as new code under an open source license.  Similarly, the design phase will focus upon how open source licensing (both with software open source licenses and also for other content using Creative Commons or consistent licenses).  

Likewise, the focus will be on using (and where needed extending or profiling) open standards and open formats for data, interactions, services and other aspects of the project.  

It is expected that the application and related host platforms and services will be developed around an Open Network approach using REST/API accessible service ports, busses and/or other interfaces.  The app can, using this approach, eventually become device agnostic as a mobile web application.  

This approach to the conherent and consistent use of open source, open licensing, open standards, open formats and open interface together comprise what can be thought of as an "Open Architecture".  This will allow for continued development in a  distributed fashion and customization to the specific requirements of federal, state, and local courts.
