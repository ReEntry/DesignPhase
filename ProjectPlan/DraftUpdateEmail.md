Hello ReEntry Team,

A few updates for you regarding the status of the ReEntry project and next steps.

1)	In accordance with Judge Aiken’s general designation in Brooklyn of Dan as the main point of contact for the project as well as the reality that Dan’s been running point for most project issues we thought it made sense to formalize that role, at least to the extent that we have formal roles, and designate Dan as the Project Lead for the ReEntry Project. This would not change much of the way that the project is currently being run but would specifically mean the following:
  
  a.	Dazza would transition to Dan responsibility for the GitHub repository and the ReEntryApp website.
  
  b.	Dan would be the main point of contact for press inquiries though likely still delegating responsibility for responding to those inquiries to our Project Press Lead.
  
  c.	Any other project responsibilities or assets that other project members possess may but certainly do not have to be transitioned to Dan as well.
  
  d.	Dazza would narrow his focus to the development of a rapid prototype of the application using open agile methodologies. Development of the application, including feedback and iteration thereon, will be conducted according to the plan described below.

We expect that this transition will take place over the next few months so that by the end of the summer/early fall Dan will be the formal project lead.

2)	In the meantime, Dazza, Dan and Becca agreed upon the following plan in order to take advantage of the MIT resources that Dazza and the folks at the Media Lab have graciously made available to develop a prototype.
  
  a.	Dazza, Dan, the Media Lab team and anyone else from this group who might be interested will work to put together a presentation – possibly a video – that describes the prototype of the ReEntry App that the Media Lab team will find resources to develop.
  
  b.	That presentation or video will be made available to Judge Aiken for her to provide commentary and feedback. 
  
  c.	As soon as Judge Aiken’s blessing on the prototype as planned has been procured, development will begin.
  
  d.	We are aiming to have a prototype complete by early August so that progress on the project, and the project more generally, can be shared at the [ABA Hackcess to Justice Hackathon] (http://hackcesstojustice2014.challengepost.com/) in Boston on August 7-8.  

As usual we’d welcome any assistance in getting all of this moved forward so chime in and let us know.
 
Thanks,
 
Dazza and Dan
