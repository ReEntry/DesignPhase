Hello ReEntry Team,

A few updates for you regarding the status of the ReEntry project and next steps.

1)	In accordance with Judge Aiken’s general designation in Brooklyn of Dan as her main point of contact for the project as well as the reality that Dan’s been running point for most project issues we thought it made sense to formalize that role, at least to the extent that we have formal roles, and designate Dan as the Project Lead for the ReEntryApp Project. This would not change much of the way that the project is currently being run but would specifically mean the following:
  
  a. Assets: Dazza will transfer ownership of the GitHub repository and the ReEntryApp domain name to Dan and Dan will hold those properties for this project.  The transition of the GitHub repository, domain name(s) and other accounts will likely take place over a few weeks at maximum.  There is no change in the understanding that all digital assets contibuted to the project by members of the project team or others are expected to exist in the GitHub repository or repositories of the project and to be covered by either Creative Commons or open source software licenses.  This means that any governmental agency or non-profit, individual or other party is perpectually and globally at liberty to access, use and modify the volunteer contributions and, as usual for any GitHub repository, the project can be forked at any time by any person with no prior permission or reason required. The website contents are all files within the GitHub repository displayed as HTML using GitHub pages.
  
  b.	Press: Dan will be the main point of contact for press inquiries and will handle the inquiries directly or as appropriate refer media to Becca as single point of contact to speak on behalf of Judge Aiken and refer to members of the  project team based on the subject matter and context.
  
  c.	Management: Dan has agreed to provide project management and leadership, including important tasks like getting the word out at events like relevant hackathons, scheduling project meetngs, arranging review of draft prototypes and opportunity for feedback with Judge Aiken, updating the web site and generally moving the project forward.  Any other project responsibilities or assets that other project members possess may but certainly do not have to be transitioned to Dan as well.  
  
  d.	Prototyping: Dazza will focus on the development of a rapid prototype of the application using open agile methodologies. Development of the application, including feedback and iteration thereon, will be conducted according to the plan described below.


2)	In the meantime, Dazza, Dan and Becca agreed upon the following plan in order to take advantage of the MIT resources that Dazza and the folks at the Media Lab have graciously made available to develop a prototype.
  
  a.	Dazza, Dan, the Media Lab team and anyone else from this group who might be interested will work to put together a presentation – possibly a video – that describes the prototype of the ReEntryApp that the Media Lab team will find resources to develop.
  
  b.	That presentation or video will be made available to Judge Aiken for her to provide commentary and feedback. 
  
  c.	As soon as Judge Aiken’s blessing on the prototype as planned has been procured, development will begin.
  
  d.	We are aiming to have a prototype complete by early August so that progress on the project, and the project more generally, can be shared at the [ABA Hackcess to Justice Hackathon](http://hackcesstojustice2014.challengepost.com/) in Boston on August 7-8.  

As usual we’d welcome any assistance in getting all of this moved forward so chime in and let us know.
 
Thanks,
 
Dazza and Dan
